## Development Workflow

This section is for developers who want to contribute to the SDK.

### Initial Setup <!-- omit in toc -->

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aave/aave-sdk.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Pre-requisites: <!-- omit in toc -->

- Node.js: >= v22. See [installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
- pnpm: v9.15.4. See [installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.js versions. Run the following command in the project root folder:

```bash
nvm use
```

to switch to the correct Node.js version.

Enable [corepack](https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-use-corepack) to use the the correct version of `pnpm`.

Run the following command in the project root folder:

```bash
corepack install
```

to install the correct version once. After that corepack will automatically use the correct version of `pnpm` when entering the project folder.

Create a `.env` file copying the `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with the correct values.

### Usage <!-- omit in toc -->

Run the tests:

- `pnpm test`: Run unit and integration tests `@aave/client` and `@aave/react` packages.
- `pnpm spec`: Run the acceptance tests for the `@aave/spec` package.

Lint the code:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Compile the code:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Clean the build:

```bash
pnpm clean
```

Create a new package:

```bash
pnpm new:package
```

### IDE Setup <!-- omit in toc -->

The project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) to format and lint the code. You can install the Biome extension for your IDE: https://biomejs.dev/guides/editors/first-party-extensions/
